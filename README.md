# Regularization and Feature Scaling in Linear regression model

## Introduction
Regularization is a technique to avoid overfitting in the model. In this notebook, I have used Lasso technique where high coefficients are penalized more. 

## Dataset 
Have a look at the dataset used here [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Regularization_and_Feature_scaling/blob/master/data.csv)  
First 6 columns are input features and last column is the label

## Sklearn Library
<code>from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso</code>  
<code>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler</code>

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
